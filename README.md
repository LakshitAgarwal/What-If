# What If? Event Landing Page

This project is a landing page for the "What If?" event. It provides information about the event, participation guidelines, and links to submission forms for different problem statements.

## Core Features

-   **Event Information:** Displays key details about the "What If?" event.
-   **Participation Guidelines:** Outlines the rules and guidelines for participating in the event.
-   **Submission Forms:** Provides direct links to submission forms for various problem statements.
-   **Visually Appealing Design:** Uses a custom stylesheet to create an engaging and informative user experience.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file serving as the entry point and user interface for the landing page.
-   `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for the visual styling of the landing page, including fonts, colors, layout, and responsiveness.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No server or complex setup is required.

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Dependencies

-   **Fonts:** The project utilizes the "League Spartan" and "Libre Baskerville" fonts from Google Fonts. The `style.css` file imports these fonts. Additionally, it uses two local fonts (`happy.ttf` and `fut.ttf`) that should be included in the repository for the page to render correctly.
-   **Background Image:** The project uses `bg.jpg` as a background image. Ensure this image is present in the same directory as the `index.html` and `style.css` files, or adjust the path in `style.css` accordingly.
