## 📦 Getting Started / Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

*   A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) for viewing and potentially modifying the code.
*   A web server (optional, for local testing).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**  If the code is hosted on a platform like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  **Download the files:** If you have been provided with the files directly, download `index.html`, `style.css`, and the image assets to a directory on your computer.

### Running Locally

2.  **Using a web server (optional):** If you want to simulate a production environment, you can use a local web server.  For example, with Python:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

    Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port) in your browser.
